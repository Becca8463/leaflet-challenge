# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge

This challenge asked us to map earthquake data such as the location and magnitude of earthquakes across the US from USGS GeoJSON Feed with Leaflet.

With the help of Fred my tutor I was able to code to create the visualization of the earthquakes. I really enjoyed this assignment and plan on doing more outside of class to plot different endpoints and other data to create different interactive maps. Dependencies JavaScript, d3, Leaflet, GeoJSON, HTML. All of my work/coding is under the index.
